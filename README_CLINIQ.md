## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following accounts and API keys:

1. **Supabase Account**: Sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Deepgram Account**: Sign up at [deepgram.com](https://deepgram.com)
3. **Google AI Account**: Get API key at [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
cd cliniq-app
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
3. Set up Row Level Security policies
4. Create a storage bucket named `medical-scans`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```env
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
REACT_APP_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### 4. Set Up Supabase Storage

In your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Storage
2. Create a new bucket called `medical-scans`
3. Set it to public or configure appropriate access policies

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:

- **patients**: Patient information and medical history
- **soap_notes**: SOAP note records with AI assistance
- **medical_scans**: Medical imaging files and AI analysis
- **voice_sessions**: Voice recording sessions and transcripts
- **doctors**: Doctor profiles and credentials
